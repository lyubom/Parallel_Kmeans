Parallel K-Means Data Clustering

The software package of parallel K-means data clustering contains the
followings:

  * A parallel implementation using OpenMP and C
  * A sequential version in C

To run:
  * On running a 'make' the following executables will be produced -
     o "parallel_main" for OpenMP version
     o "simple_main" for simple sequential version

  * To run the parallel version: "parallel_kmeans filename num_clusters number_of_threads"
  * To run the sequential version: sequential_kmeans filename num_clusters"

Input file format:
The executables read an input file that stores the data points to be
clustered. A few example files are provided in the sub-directory
./Testcases. The input files can be in ASCII text format.

  * ASCII text format:
    o Each line contains the coordinates of a single data point
    o The number of coordinates must be equal for all data points

Output files: There are two output files:
  * Coordinates of cluster centers
    o The file name is the input file name appended with ".cluster_centres".
    o It is in ASCII text format.
    o Each line contains an integer indicating the cluster id and the
      coordinates of the cluster center.
  * Membership of all data points to the clusters
    o The file name is the input file name appended with ".membership".
    o It is in ASCII text format.
    o Each line contains two integers: data point index (from 0 to
      the number of points) and the cluster id indicating the membership of
      the point.

Limitations:
    * Data type -- This implementation uses C float data type for all
      coordinates and other real numbers.

    * Large number of data points -- The number of data points cannot
      exceed 2G due to the 4-byte integers used in the programs. (But do
      let me know if it is desired.)
